    "### Test procedure for the evaluation of the proposed quaternion normalization method\n",
    "\n",
    "**Starting point**: one key difference between the applicability and accuracy of various normalization methods is the representation of the quaternion error (dynamics), which can be:\n",
    "- additive (which will be investigated here)\n",
    "- multiplicative (although the unity norm constraint will not be hurt, the formulation is generally more complex, thus the choice for the former)\n",
    "\n",
    "For _additive_ error dynamics, the straightforward way to ensure the unity norm constraint is to treat a quaternion as a vector of 4 elements which need to be normalized. However, this approach does not take into consideration the effect of the nonlinearity in the relationship between the components _s_  and  **w** of quaternion **q**. Thus, this brute-force approach will transform the error probability distribution p(**qerr**), resulting in a nonlinear relationship with the original expression.\n",
    "Considering the above, it is definitely _possible_ that this step introduces a submanifold, a subset of **Q^4**, which tends to be more error-prone than the other, resulting in a potential threat regarding applications with a high accuracy requirement.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Proposal:** COPY FROM MY NOTEBOOK\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Test procedure:**\n",
    "- Cover the manifold of the quaternions by iterating over all angles (practically in **R^3**, i.e. converting from Euler-angles)\n",
    "- Add noise to the quaternion\n",
    "- Normalize (use different methods)\n",
    "- Calculate and compare error statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hope that the proposed method is better"
